Finding the first co-op job as a software developer is a unique and difficult journey. Many students are not exposed to developing software prior to the workforce, and are unsure of what to look for and expect from a co-op placement. I was fortunate enough to work at PostBeyond, a SaaS startup developing an employee advocacy platform, located in the heart of downtown Toronto. What is working at PostBeyond like?

<b>The First Day</b>

On first day I was given a crash course of PostBeyond and familiarized myself with the codebase. From day two on, I was adding exciting new features for PostBeyond iOS and Android. Along the way I ran into many problems, met new people, and discovered the whole world of SaaS (Software as a Service). This was all overwhelming at first, but eventually you get used to it. This transition into the work force was unlike any other, from the moment I entered the door I was exposed to a working and learning environment.

<b>The Startup Environment</b>

One of the most important things when starting your co-op term is to make sure you fit in well. At PostBeyond we have an open office space where everyone works at two tables. Coming in, I knew nothing about employee advocacy, or SaaS software at all. By the end of my second week, I was caught up to speed. This was possible because of how open things are at PostBeyond, it was super easy for me to rack up a one on one conversation with someone who I just met, about a topic I knew nothing about. Being a software developer does not limit your learning to technical concepts, you should aim to understand the customers that use your products, as well as the market your product competes in. 

<b>Next Steps</b>

I'll be back in school this September for my fall term, and will be subject to the job hunting process once again at Waterloo. My time at PostBeyond gave me a ton of insight of what to expect from co-op, and was overall an awesome experience.
