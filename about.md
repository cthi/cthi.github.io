Hey! I'm Chris, a 2A Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. My passion is mobile developement, and have built a few cool apps such as LoLStorm and ATP. I like to keepup in the mobile world, building android apps with new technologies such as RxJava and Dagger.

Currently I'm working at PostBeyond, a fast pacced SaS company, building the iOS and Android applications for the employee advocacy platform.
